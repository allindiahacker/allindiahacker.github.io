            Started out as a brilliant idea by u/Hmz88 to have a Country vs Country style tournament.    
        </p>
        <p id="explain3">
            In less than a week we were joined by over 150 players from 65+ countries to make that idea a reality.
        </p>

            Currently we are in the process of setting a website up for the inaugral edition of the FPL World Cup and more details will follow as we get closer to the start.
            You can check out the list of teams and countries currently participating in the tournament.
